To further improve speed performance, the pneumatic actuator has been replaced with a larger stroke actuator, the pulley ratio has been reduced and one more inlet is added to the accumulator vessel. \r\n\r\nd.   UAV Launcher Testing.   Initial testing of launcher with integrated control system and pneumatic circuit at low, medium pressure is completed. In-house testing of launcher at SPF are also completed successfully.  Field testing for dead weight and dummy UAV launches are successfully conducted at PN GHARO facility.  The criteria of projectile launch speed, aerial time and ground range are successfully met.\r\n\r\ne.   Jet Engine Testing. Bench testing of P220 Turbo jet engine (for MARLIN-01) has been conducted. Intake duct design has been improved and manufactured. Bench testing of engine with improved intake is also conducted and results are within acceptable margins. \r\n\r\nf.   Backup P220 Engine. Maiden testing of backup P220 engine (MARLIN-01 backup) is also successfully completed.\r\n\r\ng.   Ground Testing of Marlin-01 UAVs. Extensive ground testing activities of Marlin-01 UAVs are considered essential prior to the flight trials. In this regard: airframe load tests, pitch/roll performance testing of propulsion system, avionics endurance testing, data-link range tests, parachute release mechanism tests, control surface load tests, carriage-lock thrust testing are planned. Airframe load tests, pitch/roll performance testing of propulsion system and avionics endurance tests are successfully completed. Data link range tests and parachute release mechanism tests are partly completed. During control surface load testing, problem related to deformation of control linkages and servo failure is observed. Control linkage mechanism has been upgraded to increase stiffness and rigidity. Root cause analysis of servo failure is being carried out and results will be used to further ruggedize avionics systems. Carriage-lock thrust testing of the UAV will be conducted at PN GHARO facility in Mar 22.\r\n\r\nh.   Field Testing of Marlin-01 UAVs. Field testing / launch trials of Marlin-01 UAV has been planned at PN GHARO facility in Mar 22.

In this regard, considerations are being given to weight reduction, ease of assembly and transportation. In order to keep the development, cost effective and reduce develop time imperative consideration is given to re-use of parts / sub-assemblies manufactured for the MARLIN-01 launcher. Export of manufacturing drawings and market surveys for COTs items are under progress. \r\n\r\nl.   Material Testing. Destructive Testing (DT) of composite material samples is being carried out using PNEC and PCSIR equipment. Tensile tests and first phase of bending tests are completed. Manufacturing process is improved in lines with the test results. Bending tests of improved samples are also completed. Testing of different composite coring materials are tested and coring scheme for MARLIN-02 has been finalized. \r\n\r\nm.   Wind Tunnel Testing. Computer Aided Design (CAD) model for development of testing model has been shared, as required by M/s DESTO.  Estimated of quotation & timeline of 190 working days is received from the firm. M/s DESTO has been requested to reduce timeline. Foreign WTT facilities are also being explored for the pertinent testing. \r\n\r\n3.   Hardware Procurement Status.\r\n\r\na.   Order is already placed for procurement of JetCat P-1000 (Germany based 1100N) turbo jet engine. Engine is ready at OEM facility while export license is being processed for shipment to Pakistan. EDD for the engine is Feb 22.\r\n\r\nb.   Veronte flight controller (of M/s Embention) excluding air antenna is received at INTELL NRDI. Individual components have been tested and radio link is established. Firmware update has also been received for tracker. Currently, development of controls for HSTD are being studied and range testing activates are being planned.\r\n\r\nc.   Material for fabrication of MARLIN-02 UAV and Launcher are being purchased/ procured as per manufacturing requirements.\r\n\r\nd.   Orders are placed for raw material & COTs items for MARLIN-02 UAV and Launcher. The procurement is under progress.\r\n?			350000	t	HSTD
